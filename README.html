<h1>Box Sample App</h1>

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>

<p>You need to register your Box application in order to get an API key. You can do that <a href="http://www.box.net/developers/services">here</a>.</p>

<p>While you're on that page, set your application's redirect url. This is the url the user is sent to after registering. It should be the address of your website, like &quot;http://box-sample-app.herokuapp.com&quot;.</p>

<h3>Running on Heroku</h3>

<p>Follow the normal <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">Heroku setup procedure</a> to create your application. After pushing the code, all you need to do is run:</p>

<pre><code>heroku config:add BOX_API_KEY=&lt;your api key&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Try <code>heroku open</code> and play around with your new site. It'll first prompt you to authenticate on Box, but once you've done that, you can navigate normally.</p>

<h3>Running locally</h3>

<p>It's hard to test your code when you need to push it to Heroku each time. You can run the sample app easy, you just need a few things.</p>

<p>First off, you need to have a copy of Ruby 1.9. Ruby 1.8 might work, but is losing support and is not what you will be running on Heroku.</p>

<p>With Ruby installed, use Bundler to install all of the project dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>gem install bundler
cd &lt;project root&gt;
bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, you need to launch the Sinatra server. Prefix the command with your Box api key.</p>

<pre><code>cd &lt;project root&gt;
BOX_API_KEY=&lt;your api key&gt; rackup
</code></pre>

<p>This will run the server on port 9292. Visit http://localhost:9292 to see your app in action.</p>
